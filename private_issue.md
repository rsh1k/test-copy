# Security Analysis: High and Critical CVEs in dotCMS

| No. | CVE Name | CVE Type (OWASP) | Description | Status | Likelihood of Exploitability | Explanation of Status |
|-----|----------|------------------|-------------|--------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-66516 | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Apache Tika PDF module vulnerable to denial of service via specially crafted PDF files. Present in `org.apache.tika:tika-parser-pdf-module` used in dotCMS for content parsing and document processing (FileAssetAPI, ContentletAPI). | True Positive | **High** - EPSS: N/A (recent CVE), CISA KEV: Not listed. Code is reachable through file upload functionality and PDF content processing. Attack complexity: Low - requires uploading malicious PDF. Actively exploitable in production. | dotCMS uses Tika for PDF parsing in content management operations. The vulnerability is directly reachable through the FileAsset upload functionality (`/dotCMS/src/main/java/com/dotmarketing/portlets/fileassets/business/FileAssetAPI.java`) and content indexing. No compensating controls detected for this specific DoS vector in PDF parsing. |
| 2 | CVE-2025-54988 | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Apache Tika PDF module remote code execution vulnerability through malicious PDF processing. Present in `org.apache.tika:tika-parser-pdf-module` used for document parsing. | True Positive | **Critical** - EPSS: N/A (recent CVE), CISA KEV: Not listed. Direct code path exists through file upload and content processing. Attack complexity: Low. RCE severity makes this highly attractive to attackers. | Same attack surface as CVE-2025-66516. The Tika integration in FileAssetAPI and ContentletAPI processes uploaded PDFs without sufficient sandboxing. No evidence of input validation or sandboxing controls that would prevent RCE exploitation in the Tika parser integration. |
| 3 | CVE-2024-40094 | A03:2021 - Injection | GraphQL Java parser denial of service via deeply nested queries. Present in `com.graphql-java:graphql-java` used in dotCMS GraphQL API (`/dotCMS/src/main/java/com/dotcms/graphql/`). | True Positive | **Medium** - EPSS: 0.04%, CISA KEV: Not listed. Code reachable through `/api/v1/graphql` endpoint. Attack complexity: Low but requires authenticated access in most configurations. Default query depth limits may provide partial mitigation. | dotCMS exposes GraphQL endpoints through `GraphQLAPI.java` and `GraphQLServlet.java`. While some query complexity controls exist in `GraphQLFieldProxyFactory.java`, no specific depth limiting for nested queries was found. Authenticated users can craft deeply nested queries to exhaust resources. |
| 4 | CVE-2024-47072 | A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures | XStream deserialization vulnerability allowing remote code execution. Present in `com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream` used for XML serialization in various dotCMS components. | True Positive | **High** - EPSS: 0.05%, CISA KEV: Not listed. XStream is used in cache serialization and API integrations. Attack complexity: Medium - requires ability to control XML input. Deserialization attacks are well-understood by attackers. | XStream is used in dotCMS for object serialization, particularly in cache mechanisms and REST API operations. Found in `CacheTransport.java` and legacy XML processing. No evidence of XStream security type allowlisting or deny listing configurations in `dotmarketing-config.properties` or initialization code. |
| 5 | CVE-2025-48734 | A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures | Apache Commons BeanUtils class property access vulnerability leading to RCE. Present in `commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils` used extensively throughout dotCMS for bean manipulation. | True Positive | **High** - EPSS: N/A (recent CVE), CISA KEV: Not listed. Extremely broad code surface - BeanUtils used in ContentletAPI, StructureAPI, and workflow processing. Attack complexity: Medium - requires controlling bean property inputs. | Commons BeanUtils is pervasively used in dotCMS core for dynamic bean property access in `BeanUtils.copyProperties()` calls throughout contentlet manipulation, form processing (`FormAPI.java`), and REST endpoints. No global suppression mechanism or property access filtering detected. |
| 6 | CVE-2023-24998 | A01:2021 - Broken Access Control | Apache Commons FileUpload denial of service via large file uploads consuming excessive resources. Present in `commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload` used in dotCMS upload functionality. | False Positive | **Low** - EPSS: 0.06%, CISA KEV: Not listed. While FileUpload is present, dotCMS implements file size limits in `APIProvider.java` and `FileUploadServlet.java`. Attack complexity: Low but mitigated. | dotCMS implements compensating controls in `FileAssetAPI.java` and `BinaryFileFilter.java` with configurable max file size limits (`MAX_FILE_SIZE` property). Upload size restrictions are enforced at the servlet level before FileUpload processing occurs, preventing resource exhaustion. |
| 7 | CVE-2025-48976 | A04:2021 - Insecure Design | Apache Commons FileUpload path traversal vulnerability in filename handling. Present in `commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload` used for file upload processing. | False Positive | **Low** - EPSS: N/A (recent CVE), CISA KEV: Not listed. Path traversal attempts are blocked by filename sanitization. Attack complexity: Low but compensating controls exist. | dotCMS implements filename sanitization in `FileAssetAPI.java` using `FileUtil.sanitizeFileName()` and `UtilMethods.sanitizeFileName()` which strip path traversal characters. File storage paths are controlled through `FileAssetFactory.java` with no direct user control over final storage location. |
| 8 | CVE-2024-47554 | A01:2021 - Broken Access Control | Apache Commons IO path traversal in file operations. Present in `commons-io:commons-io` used throughout dotCMS for file system operations. | False Positive | **Low** - EPSS: 0.04%, CISA KEV: Not listed. Path operations are wrapped with validation. Attack complexity: Medium - requires bypassing application-level path controls. | dotCMS wraps Commons IO usage with path validation in `FileUtil.java` and `ConfigUtils.java`. Asset paths are validated against allowed directories in `FileAssetAPI.java`. The `ASSET_REAL_PATH` and `DYNAMIC_CONTENT_PATH` configurations restrict file operations to specific directory trees. |
| 9 | CVE-2024-25638 | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | DNSJava DNSSEC validation bypass allowing DNS spoofing. Present in `dnsjava:dnsjava` used for DNS resolution in email and networking components. | True Positive | **Medium** - EPSS: 0.05%, CISA KEV: Not listed. Limited code paths use DNSJava directly. Attack complexity: High - requires MITM position. Most deployments use system DNS. | DNSJava is included as a dependency but direct usage in dotCMS core is limited. Found in email delivery components (`MailAPI.java`) for MX record lookups. No DNSSEC validation configuration found. However, exploitation requires network-level attack position, reducing likelihood. |
| 10 | GHSA-crjg-w57m-rqqf | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | DNSJava denial of service via malformed DNS responses. Present in `dnsjava:dnsjava` dependency. | True Positive | **Low** - EPSS: N/A (GitHub Advisory), CISA KEV: Not listed. Limited usage in codebase. Attack complexity: High - requires controlling DNS responses to dotCMS server. | Same attack surface as CVE-2024-25638. Limited direct usage of DNSJava in production code paths reduces exposure. Most DNS operations use standard Java networking which doesn't use DNSJava library directly. |
| 11 | GHSA-mmwx-rj87-vfgr | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | DNSJava resource exhaustion via DNS query responses. Present in `dnsjava:dnsjava` dependency. | True Positive | **Low** - EPSS: N/A (GitHub Advisory), CISA KEV: Not listed. Minimal code reachability. Attack complexity: High. | Same considerations as CVE-2024-25638 and GHSA-crjg-w57m-rqqf. The limited use of DNSJava in production code paths significantly reduces exploitability. |
| 12 | CVE-2021-37136 | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Netty Bzip2 decoder buffer overflow leading to denial of service. Present in `io.netty:netty-codec` used for HTTP/2 and WebSocket communication. | True Positive | **Medium** - EPSS: 0.24%, CISA KEV: Not listed. Netty is used in embedded Tomcat and WebSocket support. Attack complexity: Low - send compressed payload. Public exploits exist. | Netty codecs are used in dotCMS WebSocket implementation (`WebSocketContainerSupplier.java`) and potentially in Elasticsearch client communications. No specific Bzip2 decoder restrictions found. If WebSocket connections accept Bzip2 compressed frames, vulnerability is exploitable. |
| 13 | CVE-2021-37137 | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Netty SnappyFrameDecoder buffer overflow DoS. Present in `io.netty:netty-codec` used in async communication. | True Positive | **Medium** - EPSS: 0.13%, CISA KEV: Not listed. Same attack surface as CVE-2021-37136. Attack complexity: Low. | Same Netty usage as CVE-2021-37136. Snappy compression may be used in WebSocket or internal cluster communication. No evidence of decoder restrictions or frame size validation beyond defaults. |
| 14 | CVE-2012-6153 | A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures | Apache HttpClient hostname verification bypass allowing MITM attacks. Present in `org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient` used for external HTTP connections. | False Positive | **Very Low** - EPSS: 0.48%, CISA KEV: Not listed. Modern Java versions and HttpClient configuration enforce hostname verification. Attack complexity: High - requires MITM position and older Java runtime. | dotCMS uses HttpClient in `HttpClientFactory.java` and REST client utilities. Modern HttpClient 4.5+ with Java 8+ enables hostname verification by default. Review of `RestClientBuilder.java` shows SSL context configuration uses default verification. Legacy CVE from 2012 unlikely to apply to current implementations. |
| 15 | CVE-2021-40690 | A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures | Apache Santuario XML Signature Wrapping vulnerability allowing signature bypass. Present in `org.apache.santuario:xmlsec` used for XML security. | True Positive | **Low** - EPSS: 0.05%, CISA KEV: Not listed. Limited XML signature usage in codebase. Attack complexity: High - requires XML signature implementation and ability to modify signed documents. | XML signature validation is used in SAML integration (`SamlAuthenticationServiceImpl.java`). The vulnerability could allow signature wrapping attacks on SAML responses. However, SAML usage is optional and not core functionality. No additional signature position validation detected beyond library defaults. |
| 16 | CVE-2025-55752 | A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration | Apache Tomcat request smuggling vulnerability via malformed HTTP requests. Present in `org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-catalina` embedded server. | True Positive | **High** - EPSS: N/A (recent CVE), CISA KEV: Not listed. Tomcat is embedded in dotCMS deployment. Attack complexity: Medium - requires crafted HTTP requests. Request smuggling actively exploited in wild. | dotCMS embeds Tomcat via `TomcatServer.java` and `DotTomcatInitializer.java`. The embedded Tomcat configuration in `server.xml` does not show explicit HTTP parser strictness settings. Request smuggling could bypass security filters and access control. Frontend proxy configurations may provide mitigation. |
| 17 | CVE-2016-1000338 | A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures | BouncyCastle DSA signature generation vulnerability using weak random. Present in `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on` crypto provider. | True Positive | **Low** - EPSS: 0.11%, CISA KEV: Not listed. BouncyCastle used but DSA signature generation is rare. Attack complexity: High - requires capturing multiple DSA signatures and cryptanalysis. Legacy algorithm. | BouncyCastle is included as crypto provider in `CryptographyAPI.java`. However, dotCMS primarily uses RSA/ECDSA for modern cryptographic operations. DSA usage would be in legacy integrations only. Review of key generation code shows preference for RSA. |
| 18 | CVE-2016-1000340 | A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures | BouncyCastle DSA key pair generation weakness. Present in `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on`. | True Positive | **Low** - EPSS: 0.08%, CISA KEV: Not listed. Same considerations as CVE-2016-1000338. DSA not commonly used in modern dotCMS deployments. | Same analysis as CVE-2016-1000338. Limited DSA usage in current codebase reduces risk. |
| 19 | CVE-2016-1000342 | A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures | BouncyCastle ECDSA timing attack vulnerability. Present in `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on`. | True Positive | **Low** - EPSS: 0.07%, CISA KEV: Not listed. ECDSA used in some JWT implementations. Attack complexity: High - requires precise timing measurements and statistical analysis. | BouncyCastle ECDSA may be used in JWT token signing (`JsonWebTokenUtils.java`). Timing attacks require local access or precise network timing. The vulnerability is mitigated by network latency in typical deployments. |
| 20 | CVE-2016-1000343 | A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures | BouncyCastle weak DHIES encryption. Present in `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on`. | True Positive | **Very Low** - EPSS: 0.06%, CISA KEV: Not listed. DHIES not used in dotCMS core. Attack complexity: High - requires specific algorithm usage. | DHIES (Diffie-Hellman Integrated Encryption Scheme) is not used in dotCMS core cryptographic operations. Standard TLS and symmetric encryption (AES) are used instead. No code references found to DHIES. |
| 21 | CVE-2016-1000344 | A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures | BouncyCastle DSA key validation bypass. Present in `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on`. | True Positive | **Low** - EPSS: 0.07%, CISA KEV: Not listed.
