| Number | CVE Name | CVE Type (OWASP) | Description | Status | Explanation of Status |
|--------|----------|------------------|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-66516 | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Apache Tika PDF parser vulnerability allowing arbitrary code execution through crafted PDF files | ✔ | dotCMS uses tika-parser-pdf-module in dotCMS-core/core/pom.xml and processes PDF files through ContentletAPI and FileAssetAPI without sufficient input validation or sandboxing before passing to Tika |
| 2 | CVE-2025-54988 | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Apache Tika PDF parser vulnerability enabling DoS or information disclosure via malicious PDF documents | ✔ | Same vulnerable component used in PDF processing workflows; no compensating controls found in TikaUtils or BinaryExporter classes that would prevent malicious PDF exploitation |
| 3 | CVE-2024-40094 | A03:2021 – Injection | GraphQL Java parser vulnerability allowing denial of service through deeply nested queries | ✔ | dotCMS GraphQL implementation in dotCMS/src/main/java/com/dotcms/graphql/ lacks query depth limiting or complexity analysis; vulnerable graphql-java version used without query cost analysis wrapper |
| 4 | CVE-2024-47072 | A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures | XStream deserialization vulnerability enabling remote code execution via untrusted XML input | ✔ | XStream used in multiple areas including ESContentFactoryImpl and notification systems without whitelisting or hardened security configuration; no denyTypes/allowTypes configuration detected |
| 5 | CVE-2025-48734 | A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures | Commons BeanUtils property injection vulnerability allowing arbitrary code execution | ✔ | Commons BeanUtils heavily used throughout codebase for dynamic property setting (BeanHandler, ContentletTransformer); no input filtering on property names before BeanUtils invocation |
| 6 | CVE-2023-24998 | A01:2021 – Broken Access Control | Commons FileUpload allows unlimited file upload sizes leading to DoS | ✗ | dotCMS implements compensating controls in FileUploadMaxSizeFilter and UploadServlet with configurable size limits (MAX_FILE_SIZE, MAX_REQUEST_SIZE) enforced before Commons FileUpload processing |
| 7 | CVE-2025-48976 | A01:2021 – Broken Access Control | Commons FileUpload path traversal vulnerability in file upload handling | ✔ | While FileAssetAPI has some path validation, direct usage of Commons FileUpload in UploadServlet and FileUploadFilter doesn't sanitize filenames before storage; path traversal sequences not fully stripped |
| 8 | CVE-2024-47554 | A01:2021 – Broken Access Control | Commons IO path traversal vulnerability in file operations | ✔ | FileUtil and FileAssetAPI use Commons IO FileUtils extensively for file operations; insufficient path canonicalization checks before using FileUtils.copyFile and similar methods |
| 9 | CVE-2024-25638 | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | DNSJava KeyTrap vulnerability causing algorithmic complexity DoS in DNSSEC validation | ✔ | DNSJava used for DNS lookups in email validation and external service integrations; no rate limiting or timeout protections around DNS resolution calls |
| 10 | GHSA-crjg-w57m-rqqf | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | DNSJava vulnerability allowing DNS cache poisoning | ✔ | DNSJava dependency present in pom.xml; DNS responses not validated with additional integrity checks beyond library's built-in mechanisms |
| 11 | GHSA-mmwx-rj87-vfgr | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | DNSJava DNSSEC validation bypass vulnerability | ✔ | Same vulnerable DNSJava version; email validation and SPF record lookups rely on library without additional DNSSEC validation layers |
| 12 | CVE-2021-37136 | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Netty codec buffer overflow vulnerability enabling DoS or RCE | ✔ | Netty used for HTTP/2 and WebSocket communication in push publishing and cluster communication; no input size validation before Netty buffer operations |
| 13 | CVE-2021-37137 | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Netty codec HTTP request smuggling vulnerability | ✔ | Netty handles HTTP requests in proxy and cluster transport layers without request normalization; vulnerable to request smuggling attacks in multi-node deployments |
| 14 | CVE-2012-6153 | A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures | Apache HttpClient hostname verification disabled allowing MITM attacks | ✗ | dotCMS ConfigService and ESClient configure HttpClient with proper SSLConnectionSocketFactory and hostname verification enabled; custom TrustStrategy implementations validate certificates |
| 15 | CVE-2021-40690 | A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures | Apache Santuario XML Security signature wrapping vulnerability | ✔ | XML signature validation in SAML implementation (DotSamlResource) uses xmlsec without additional signature wrapping protections; vulnerable to XML signature bypass attacks |
