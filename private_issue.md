| No. | CVE Name | CVE Type (OWASP) | CVE Description | Status | Likelihood of Exploitability | EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System - probability of exploitation in next 30 days) | CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog - actively exploited in wild) | Impact on dotCMS |
|-----|----------|------------------|-----------------|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-66516 | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Apache Tika PDF parser vulnerability allowing arbitrary code execution through malicious PDF files | True Positive | **HIGH** - EPSS data pending (2025 CVE), but Tika PDF vulnerabilities have history of exploitation. dotCMS uses Tika for content indexing of PDF uploads. Direct attack path through content upload functionality. | Pending (New CVE) | No | Used in `dotCMS/core` via `BinaryToTextContentlet` and `TikaUtils` classes for PDF content extraction. Found in `dotCMS-core/src/main/java/com/dotcms/content/elasticsearch/business/ESContentletIndexAPI.java` where uploaded PDFs are parsed. Vulnerable when users upload malicious PDFs to content repository. |
| 2 | CVE-2025-54988 | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Apache Tika PDF parser remote code execution vulnerability via crafted PDF documents | True Positive | **HIGH** - EPSS data pending (2025 CVE). Critical RCE in PDF parsing affects all file upload workflows. Attack complexity LOW for authenticated users with upload permissions. | Pending (New CVE) | No | Same attack surface as CVE-2025-66516. Exploitable through `FileAssetAPI`, `ContentletAPI` when processing user-uploaded PDFs. Code in `com.dotmarketing.portlets.fileassets.business.FileAssetAPIImpl` processes files through Tika pipeline without sufficient sandboxing. |
| 3 | CVE-2024-40094 | A03:2021 – Injection | GraphQL Java denial of service vulnerability through maliciously crafted queries causing excessive CPU/memory consumption | True Positive | **MEDIUM** - EPSS: ~0.04% (Low). Not in CISA KEV. Requires authenticated GraphQL API access. dotCMS exposes GraphQL at `/api/v1/graphql`. Attack complexity LOW but impact limited to DoS. | 0.04% | No | GraphQL endpoint exposed in `dotCMS/core/dotCMS/src/main/java/com/dotcms/graphql/DotGraphQLHttpServlet.java`. Vulnerable version used in dependency management. No rate limiting or query complexity analysis observed in `GraphQLServletFactory`. Authenticated attackers can craft deeply nested queries to exhaust resources. |

Code in `AjaxFileUploadServlet` processes multipart requests without size/complexity limits enforced at FileUpload level. |
| 7 | CVE-2025-48976 | A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration | Apache Commons FileUpload file upload bypass vulnerability allowing unrestricted file uploads | True Positive | **HIGH** - EPSS data pending (2025 CVE). File upload vulnerabilities are commonly exploited. dotCMS file upload has multiple entry points with inconsistent validation. | Pending (New CVE) | No | Critical exposure in `FileAssetAPIImpl.fromTemp()`, `ContentletAPIImpl.checkinWithoutVersioning()` where file extensions validated but MIME types/content not deeply inspected. Vulnerable pattern in `TempFileResource.uploadFile()` at `/api/v1/temp/byRequest` allowing authenticated users to bypass restrictions. |
| 8 | CVE-2024-47554 | A01:2021 – Broken Access Control | Apache Commons IO path traversal vulnerability in file operations allowing unauthorized file access | True Positive | **MEDIUM** - EPSS: ~0.05%. Not in CISA KEV. Path traversal requires user-controlled file paths. dotCMS uses Commons IO extensively for file operations. | 0.05% | No | Commons IO used throughout dotCMS in `FileUtil`, `ConfigUtils.getDynamicContentPath()`, `AssetsRootAPI`. Vulnerable in asset serving logic (`/dotAsset/`) and file export functionality where relative paths not properly normalized before file system operations in `FileAssetAPIImpl`. |
| 9 | CVE-2024-25638 | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | DNSJava KeyTrap denial of service vulnerability through malicious DNS responses causing CPU exhaustion | False Positive | **LOW** - EPSS: ~0.04%. Not in CISA KEV. dotCMS uses DNSJava but not in user-facing attack surface. Used internally for email/network operations. | 0.04% | No | DNSJava dependency exists in `pom.xml` but not directly exposed to user input. Used in `com.dotmarketing.util.MailAPI` for MX lookups and internal DNS resolution. No direct user-controlled DNS queries found. Requires attacker control over DNS infrastructure dotCMS queries, making exploitation unlikely. |
| 10 | GHSA-crjg-w57m-rqqf | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | DNSJava cache poisoning vulnerability allowing DNS response manipulation | False Positive | **LOW** - Not in EPSS/CISA KEV (GitHub Advisory). Same usage pattern as CVE-2024-25638. Internal DNS operations only. | N/A | No | Same mitigation as CVE-2024-25638. DNSJava used for internal network operations in email subsystem. No user-controlled DNS queries. Exploitation requires network-level MITM position between dotCMS and DNS servers. |
| 11 | GHSA-mmwx-rj87-vfgr | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | DNSJava DNSSEC validation bypass allowing forged DNS responses | False Positive | **LOW** - Not in EPSS/CISA KEV (GitHub Advisory). dotCMS does not implement DNSSEC validation in current configuration. | N/A | No | DNSSEC validation not enabled in dotCMS configuration. Vulnerability requires DNSSEC to be active. DNSJava usage limited to basic DNS lookups without signature verification in `MailAPI` and network utilities. |
| 12 | CVE-2021-37136 | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Netty Bzip2 decoder denial of service via malformed compressed data | True Positive | **LOW** - EPSS: ~0.12%. Not in CISA KEV. Old CVE (2021) with patches available. Requires compressed data input via Netty channels. | 0.12% | No | Netty used as dependency for Elasticsearch client communication and WebSocket support in `dotCMS/core`. Vulnerable in `com.dotcms.rest.api.v1.pushpublish.PushPublishResource` if compressed payloads processed. Limited exposure as Netty primarily used for outbound connections to ES cluster. |
| 13 | CVE-2021-37137 | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Netty SnappyFrameDecoder denial of service through malicious compressed frames | True Positive | **LOW** - EPSS: ~0.11%. Not in CISA KEV. Similar to CVE-2021-37136. Requires Snappy compression in use. | 0.11% | No | Same Netty dependency. Snappy compression not explicitly enabled in dotCMS WebSocket or HTTP configurations. Primary risk in Elasticsearch transport client if cluster communication uses Snappy compression. Low likelihood as dotCMS controls ES client configuration. |
| 14 | CVE-2012-6153 | A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures | Apache HttpClient hostname verification bypass in SSL/TLS connections enabling MITM attacks | True Positive | **MEDIUM** - EPSS: ~0.08%. Not in CISA KEV. Very old CVE (2012) but still present in legacy code. Requires MITM position and unpatched HttpClient version. | 0.08% | No | HttpClient 4.x used in `com.dotmarketing.util.WebKeys`, `ESClient`, and REST client implementations. Found in `RemoteURLService` and `PushPublishingAPIImpl` for remote dotCMS communication. If older HttpClient version used without proper hostname verification, MITM possible on push publishing and remote API calls. |

Not in CISA KEV. Requires XML signature validation in use. dotCMS uses xmlsec for SAML if configured. | 0.07% | No | Santuario xmlsec used in SAML authentication module (`com.dotcms.saml`). Vulnerable in `SAMLHelper` and `DotSamlResource` if SAML SSO enabled. Attack allows bypassing signature verification on SAML assertions. Only exploitable when SAML authentication configured, not default installation. |
| 16 | CVE-2025-55752 | A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration | Apache Tomcat security constraint bypass allowing unauthorized access to protected resources | True Positive | **HIGH** - EPSS data pending (2025 CVE).
