| No. | CVE Name | CVE Type (OWASP) | Description | Status | Likelihood of Exploitability | EPSS (Exploitability Probability Score) | Impact on dotCMS (Explanation of Status) |
|-----|----------|------------------|-------------|--------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-66516 | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Apache Tika PDF parser vulnerability allowing arbitrary code execution through malicious PDF files. Present in `tika-parser-pdf-module` used for content extraction in dotCMS `/dotCMS/src/main/java/com/dotcms/content/elasticsearch/business/` and binary file processing. | True Positive | High | EPSS: Data not available (2025 CVE). CISA KEV: Not listed. Code is reachable through file upload and indexing. Attack complexity: Low - requires crafted PDF upload. | dotCMS uses Apache Tika for PDF parsing in content indexing pipeline. The vulnerability is exploitable when users upload malicious PDF files through the content management interface. File upload occurs in `/dotCMS/src/main/java/com/dotcms/storage/` and processed by Elasticsearch indexing in `/dotCMS/src/main/java/com/dotcms/content/elasticsearch/business/ESContentletIndexAPI.java`. No compensating controls detected for malicious PDF detection. |
| 2 | CVE-2025-54988 | A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Apache Tika PDF parser vulnerability enabling DoS or information disclosure through specially crafted PDF documents. Affects same components as CVE-2025-66516 in content extraction workflows. | True Positive | High | EPSS: Data not available (2025 CVE). CISA KEV: Not listed. Direct code path through content upload and binary field indexing. Attack complexity: Low. | Same attack surface as CVE-2025-66516. dotCMS processes uploaded PDFs for full-text indexing without adequate validation. The vulnerability exists in the content indexing chain where binary files are parsed. Located in `/dotCMS/src/main/java/com/dotcms/content/elasticsearch/business/ESMappingAPIImpl.java` and related indexing classes. |
