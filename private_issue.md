| 3 | Trivy | CVE-2024-40094 | A03:2021 - Injection | GraphQL Java denial of service vulnerability through deeply nested queries. DotCMS GraphQL API implementation does not enforce sufficient query depth limits or complexity analysis to prevent resource exhaustion attacks. | ✔ |
| 4 | Trivy | CVE-2024-47072 | A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures | XStream deserialization vulnerability allowing remote code execution. DotCMS uses XStream for XML processing in various components including content import/export and configuration without safe type filtering. | ✔ |
| 5 | Trivy | CVE-2025-48734 | A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures | Apache Commons BeanUtils unsafe deserialization leading to RCE. DotCMS utilizes BeanUtils throughout the codebase for property manipulation and object introspection without adequate deserialization controls. | ✔ |
| 6 | Trivy | CVE-2023-24998 | A01:2021 - Broken Access Control | Apache Commons FileUpload denial of service through malformed file upload requests. DotCMS file upload functionality in content management and binary file handling is vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks. | ✔ |
| 7 | Trivy | CVE-2025-48976 | A01:2021 - Broken Access Control | Commons FileUpload path traversal and file handling vulnerability. DotCMS temporary file handling and upload processing does not sufficiently validate file paths and destinations. | ✔ |
| 8 | Trivy | CVE-2024-47554 | A01:2021 - Broken Access Control | Apache Commons IO path traversal vulnerability in file operations. DotCMS file system operations and asset management use Commons IO without comprehensive path validation against directory traversal attacks. | ✔ |
| 9 | Trivy | CVE-2024-25638 | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | DNSJava denial of service through malformed DNS responses. DotCMS uses DNSJava for DNS resolution in email and network operations without timeout and response size protections. | ✔ |
| 10 | Trivy | GHSA-crjg-w57m-rqqf | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | DNSJava KeyResolver vulnerability enabling DNS cache poisoning. DotCMS DNS resolution for DKIM verification and email routing lacks DNSSEC validation and response verification. | ✔ |
| 11 | Trivy | GHSA-mmwx-rj87-vfgr | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | DNSJava TSIG verification bypass vulnerability. DotCMS DNS operations do not implement proper cryptographic verification of DNS transaction signatures. | ✔ |
| 12 | Trivy | CVE-2021-37136 | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Netty HTTP/2 codec denial of service via header memory exhaustion. DotCMS uses Netty for async HTTP operations and WebSocket support without header size limitations. | ✔ |
| 13 | Trivy | CVE-2021-37137 | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Netty codec denial of service through malformed HTTP/2 requests. DotCMS Netty implementation lacks request validation and resource limits for HTTP/2 frame processing. | ✔ |
| 14 | Trivy | CVE-2012-6153 | A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures | Apache HttpClient improper hostname verification in SSL/TLS connections. DotCMS HttpClient usage for external integrations and REST clients does not enforce strict hostname verification. | ✔ |
