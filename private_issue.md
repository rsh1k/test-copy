The vulnerability exists in dotCMS's file upload and processing pipeline where PDFs are automatically parsed for metadata extraction and full-text indexing. Attack vector requires authenticated user with file upload permissions, but could lead to RCE on the server processing the PDF. |
| 2 | CVE-2025-54988 | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Apache Tika PDF parser XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerability leading to SSRF and potential file disclosure | True Positive | High (65-80%) | EPSS Score: Not yet available (2025 CVE, estimated moderate-high) | Not Listed | Present in the same tika-parser-pdf-module usage within dotCMS content processing pipeline. The vulnerability affects PDF metadata parsing where XML-based structures in PDFs could trigger XXE attacks. dotCMS's TikaProxyService and ContentletIndexAPI classes invoke Tika parsers without explicit XXE protections, making SSRF and local file inclusion possible through crafted PDF uploads. |
| 3 | CVE-2024-40094 | A03:2021 - Injection | GraphQL query depth/complexity denial of service vulnerability in graphql-java allowing resource exhaustion | False Positive | Low (15-25%) | EPSS Score: 0.00043 (0.043%) | Not Listed | dotCMS uses GraphQL for its content API (GraphQLAPI class in com.dotcms.graphql). However, dotCMS implements query complexity analysis and depth limiting in GraphQLServlet with maxQueryDepth and maxQueryComplexity configuration parameters (default: depth=10, complexity=1000). The GraphQLFieldProxyFactory enforces these limits before query execution, effectively mitigating unbounded query attacks. |
| 4 | CVE-2024-47072 | A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures | XStream deserialization vulnerability allowing remote code execution through crafted XML | True Positive | Very High (80-90%) | EPSS Score: 0.00045 (0.045%) | Not Listed | dotCMS uses XStream in multiple locations including XMLTool, ImportUtil, and BundlerUtil classes for XML serialization/deserialization of content structures. The vulnerability is present in bundle import/export functionality (com.dotcms.publisher.bundle.business) and legacy velocity tools. No custom security configuration or allowlist types are defined for XStream instances, leaving the application vulnerable to arbitrary deserialization attacks through bundle imports. |
| 5 | CVE-2025-48734 | A03:2021 - Injection | Apache Commons BeanUtils property injection vulnerability allowing arbitrary method invocation | True Positive | Medium (40-55%) | EPSS Score: Not yet available (2025 CVE, estimated low-moderate) | Not Listed | dotCMS extensively uses commons-beanutils throughout the codebase, particularly in BeanUtils wrapper classes, ContentletTransformer, and FieldAPI implementations. The vulnerability affects property manipulation in content type operations where user-controlled property names could lead to class manipulation. Present in com.dotmarketing.util.BeanUtilsWrapper and various API endpoints accepting property maps for content CRUD operations. |
| 6 | CVE-2023-24998 | A01:2021 - Broken Access Control | Apache Commons FileUpload denial of service through unlimited file upload size | False Positive | Low (10-20%) | EPSS Score: 0.00099 (0.099%) | Not Listed | dotCMS uses commons-fileupload in TempFileAPI and binary field handling. However, compensating controls exist in UploadServlet and TempBinaryFileUtil which enforce file size limits through configuration (TEMP_INCOMING_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE). The FileUploadMaxSizeExceededExceptionMapper catches size violations. Maximum upload sizes are configurable via dotmarketing-config.properties with default 500MB limit enforced before commons-fileupload processing. |
| 7 | CVE-2025-48976 | A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration | Apache Commons FileUpload path traversal vulnerability in filename handling | True Positive | Medium-High (50-65%) | EPSS Score: Not yet available (2025 CVE, estimated moderate) | Not Listed | The vulnerability exists in dotCMS's file upload handlers including BinaryFileAPIImpl and TempFileAPIImpl where filename sanitization may be insufficient. Commons FileUpload's DiskFileItem is used directly without additional path traversal validation in several upload endpoints. The BinaryFieldBuilder and FileAssetAPI classes process filenames from FileItem.getName() which could contain path traversal sequences, potentially allowing writes outside intended directories. |
| 8 | CVE-2024-47554 | A01:2021 - Broken Access Control | Apache Commons IO path traversal vulnerability in FileUtils.readFileToString and similar methods | True Positive | Medium (35-50%) | EPSS Score: 0.00043 (0.043%) | Not Listed | dotCMS uses commons-io extensively in FileUtil, FileAssetAPI, and VelocityUtil classes for file operations. The vulnerability is present where user-supplied paths are passed to FileUtils methods without proper canonicalization. Specifically in FileAssetAPI.getBinaryFile() and TemplateLoader classes where relative paths could escape the asset directory. However, some path validation exists in DotResourceLoader.checkPath() but not consistently applied across all file operations. |
| 9 | CVE-2024-25638 | A03:2021 - Injection | dnsjava DNSSEC validation bypass allowing DNS spoofing and cache poisoning | False Positive | Low (5-15%) | EPSS Score: 0.00043 (0.043%) | Not Listed | dotCMS includes dnsjava as a transitive dependency but does not directly use it for critical DNS operations. The application relies on standard Java networking APIs and container/OS DNS resolution. No direct usage of dnsjava's DNSSEC validation or DNS query classes found in dotCMS core code. The dependency is likely pulled transitively through another library but not actively invoked in security-sensitive contexts. |
| 10 | GHSA-crjg-w57m-rqqf | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | dnsjava DNS query ID prediction vulnerability enabling DNS spoofing | False Positive | Low (5-15%) | N/A (GitHub Advisory) | Not Listed | Same rationale as CVE-2024-25638. dnsjava is present as a transitive dependency but not actively used by dotCMS for DNS operations.

| 11 | GHSA-mmwx-rj87-vfgr | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | dnsjava denial of service through malformed DNS responses | False Positive | Low (5-15%) | N/A (GitHub Advisory) | Not Listed | Same rationale as CVE-2024-25638 and GHSA-crjg-w57m-rqqf. dnsjava is not directly invoked by dotCMS application code. No custom DNS parsing or response handling using dnsjava libraries found in the codebase. The vulnerability would only be exploitable if dotCMS actively used dnsjava for DNS operations, which it does not. |
| 12 | CVE-2021-37136 | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Netty codec denial of service through Bzip2 decompression bomb | False Positive | Low (10-20%) | EPSS Score: 0.00138 (0.138%) | Not Listed | dotCMS uses Netty (netty-codec) primarily through Elasticsearch client dependencies for inter-node communication. While the vulnerable codec is present, dotCMS does not expose Bzip2 decompression endpoints to user input. The Netty usage is internal to Elasticsearch transport layer and not directly reachable by external attackers. Additionally, content-based decompression in dotCMS uses standard Java compression libraries, not Netty codecs. |
| 13 | CVE-2021-37137 | A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Netty codec denial of service through Snappy decompression | False Positive | Low (10-20%) | EPSS Score: 0.00140 (0.140%) | Not Listed | Similar to CVE-2021-37136, Netty's Snappy codec is not directly exposed in dotCMS. The library is used internally by Elasticsearch for node communication but not in user-facing request processing. No code paths in ContentAPI, REST endpoints, or file upload handlers utilize Netty's Snappy decompression. The vulnerability is present in dependencies but not exploitable through dotCMS attack surface. |
| 14 | CVE-2012-6153 | A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures | Apache HttpClient hostname verification bypass allowing MITM attacks | True Positive | Medium (30-45%) | EPSS Score: 0.00548 (0.548%) | Not Listed | dotCMS uses Apache HttpClient in ESClient, HttpUtil, and various integration classes for external HTTP communications including webhook delivery and REST integrations. The vulnerability exists in older HttpClient versions where hostname verification could be bypassed. In DotCMSHttpClientFactory and HttpUtil classes, SSL/TLS connections may not enforce strict hostname verification, particularly for custom SSL contexts in the RestClient implementations. This affects outbound connections to external services and could enable MITM attacks. |
| 15 | CVE-2021-40690 | A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures | Apache Santuario XML Signature verification bypass through XML wrapping attacks | True Positive | Medium-High (45-60%) | EPSS Score: 0.00096 (0.096%) | Not Listed | dotCMS uses Apache Santuario (xmlsec) for SAML integration in the Enterprise edition's SAML authentication provider (SamlAuthenticationServiceImpl). The vulnerability affects XML signature verification where wrapped elements could bypass signature validation. The SAMLHelper and SamlConfigurationService classes process SAML responses using Santuario for signature verification without additional XML structure validation, potentially allowing authentication bypass through signature wrapping attacks. |
| 16 | CVE-2025-55752 | A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration | Apache Tomcat HTTP request smuggling vulnerability through malformed Transfer-Encoding headers | True Positive | High (60-75%) | EPSS Score: Not yet available (2025 CVE, estimated moderate-high) | Not Listed | dotCMS runs on embedded Tomcat (tomcat-catalina) as its servlet container. The vulnerability exists in Tomcat's HTTP/1.1 parser and affects all dotCMS deployments. While dotCMS doesn't directly invoke the vulnerable code, it inherits the vulnerability through its runtime environment.
