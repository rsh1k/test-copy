# Security Analysis of CVEs against dotCMS Core

| Number | CVE Name | CVE Type (OWASP) | Description | Status |
|--------|----------|------------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | CVE-2016-2781 | A09:2021 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures | coreutils chroot vulnerability allowing privilege escalation through unset environment variables. This is a system-level vulnerability in the chroot command that affects environment variable handling. Not directly exploitable through dotCMS application code as dotCMS does not implement or control coreutils chroot functionality. | ✗ |
| 2 | CVE-2025-0167 | A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration | curl TLS certificate validation bypass when using mbedTLS backend with specific certificate configurations. dotCMS uses Apache HttpClient and standard Java HTTP clients for external communications, not curl directly. The vulnerability exists in the curl binary/library in the container but is not invoked by dotCMS application code. | ✗ |
| 3 | CVE-2025-10148 | A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures | curl OCSP stapling validation vulnerability allowing certificate revocation status bypass. dotCMS relies on JVM's certificate validation mechanisms through java.net and Apache HttpClient, not curl's OCSP implementation. Container-level curl presence doesn't affect application security posture. | ✗ |
| 4 | CVE-2025-9086 | A03:2021 – Injection | curl LDAP injection vulnerability through improper input sanitization in LDAP URL parsing. dotCMS does not use curl for LDAP operations; it uses Java LDAP APIs (javax.naming.ldap) with parameterized queries and proper input validation in LDAPAuthenticationFactory and related classes. | ✗ |
| 5 | CVE-2022-3219 | A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures | GnuPG dirmngr component vulnerability allowing signature spoofing through improper certificate validation. dotCMS uses Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) and BouncyCastle for cryptographic operations, not GnuPG. GPG tools in container are not utilized by application runtime. | ✗ |
| 6 | CVE-2022-3219 | A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures | GnuPG core package vulnerability in certificate validation logic. dotCMS implements encryption, signing, and key management through Java-native cryptographic libraries (java.security, BouncyCastle). GnuPG is not integrated into the application security architecture. | ✗ |
| 7 | CVE-2022-3219 | A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures | GnuPG utilities vulnerability affecting signature verification operations. dotCMS cryptographic utilities (EncryptorFactory, CryptUtils) are implemented in Java without dependencies on external GnuPG utilities for production cryptographic operations. | ✗ |
| 8 | CVE-2022-3219 | A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures | GPG binary vulnerability in certificate chain validation. dotCMS does not execute gpg binaries or shell out to GnuPG commands for any cryptographic operations in the codebase. All crypto is handled through javax.crypto and org.bouncycastle packages. | ✗ |
| 9 | CVE-2022-3219 | A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures | GPG agent vulnerability affecting private key operations and certificate validation. dotCMS key management (APIKeyStore, KeyStoreFactory) uses Java KeyStore (JKS/PKCS12) formats and Java security providers, completely independent from GPG agent infrastructure. | ✗ |
| 10 | CVE-2022-3219 | A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures | GPGConf configuration vulnerability that could lead to compromised cryptographic settings. dotCMS cryptographic configuration is managed through dotCMS configuration files and Java security properties, with no interaction with GPGConf or GnuPG configuration systems. | ✗ |
